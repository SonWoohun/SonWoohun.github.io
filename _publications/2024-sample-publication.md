This is a sample publication file to demonstrate the publication system structure. In a real publication, you would include:

- Full citation information
- Abstract or summary
- Links to paper, code, data
- BibTeX citation

The key elements for the categorization system are:
- `collection: publications` (matches the collection name)
- `category: manuscripts` (matches one of the categories in publication_category)
- The permalink structure
- Standard front matter (title, excerpt, date)
