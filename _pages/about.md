Welcome to my academic website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [The Ohio State University](https://economics.osu.edu/), where I focus on cutting-edge research in industrial organization, applied econometrics, and decision theory.

## Research Interests

My research examines how **limited attention** affects consumer behavior and market outcomes, with particular emphasis on:

- **Industrial Organization**: How firms compete when consumers have limited attention
- **Applied Econometrics**: Developing methods to identify consumer preferences with unobserved constraints  
- **Decision Theory**: Understanding choice behavior under attention and budget limitations
- **Advertising Economics**: The role of attention capture in advertising effectiveness
- **Discrete Choice Models**: Incorporating realistic constraints into consumer choice modeling

## Current Research

I am currently working on projects that bridge theory and empirical analysis:

1. **Limited Attention in Advertising**: Investigating how consumer attention constraints shape advertising strategies and market competition
2. **Unobserved Budget Constraints**: Developing identification strategies for discrete choice models with unobserved affordability constraints
3. **Vertical Differentiation and Consumer Choice**: Using within-brand quality variation to understand consumer preferences

## Academic Background
