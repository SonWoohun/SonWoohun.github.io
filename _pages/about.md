Welcome to my academic website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [The Ohio State University](https://economics.osu.edu/), where I focus on cutting-edge research in industrial organization, applied econometrics, and decision theory.

## Research Interests

My research examines how **limited opportunity** such as *attention* or *budget constraints* affects consumer behavior and market outcomes, with particular emphasis on:

- **Industrial Organization**: How firms compete in advertisement when consumers have limited attention
- **Applied Econometrics**: Developing methods to identify parameters of interest when structural models were brought into applied works
- **Decision Theory**: Developing methods to test Random Utility Model (RUM), and characterizing stochastic transitivity

## Current Research

I am currently working on projects that bridge theory and empirical analysis:

1. **Limited Attention in Advertising**: Investigating how consumer attention constraints shape advertising strategies and market competition
2. **Unobserved Budget Constraints**: Developing identification strategies for discrete choice models with unobserved affordability constraints
3. **Vertical Differentiation and Consumer Choice**: Using within-brand quality variation to understand consumer preferences

## Academic Background

- **Ph.D. in Economics** (expected 2028), The Ohio State University
