This paper investigates how consumer attention constraints influence firm's product positioning decisions in vertically and horizontally differentiated markets. When consumers have limited attention and cannot process all available product information, firms may strategically design products to capture attention through salient attributes. 

We develop a model where firms choose product characteristics considering both standard demand factors and attention capture effects. Our preliminary results suggest that attention constraints can lead to excessive differentiation in some attributes while causing convergence in others, potentially reducing overall market efficiency.

Key contributions:
- Theoretical framework linking limited attention to product positioning
- Empirical strategy using eye-tracking data to measure attention allocation
- Policy implications for market regulation in attention-competitive industries

Status: Draft in preparation, preliminary results available upon request.
